    <h1>A Little History of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <p><em>See also <a href>How It All Started</a> presentation materials from the <a href>How It All Started</a> and <a href>other references</a></em>.<br>

        from 1945 to 1995<br>
        <h2>1945</h2>
        <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href>an article</a> in <a href>Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
        <h2>1960s</h2>
        <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href>Bootstrap Institute library</a>.<br><br>

            Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <em>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate</em>. 20th National Conference, New York, <a href>Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.<br><br>
            
            Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.
        </p>
            <h2>1980</h2>
            <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href>Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> or as <a href>HTML page(alt)</a>.

                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See <a href>the first browser</a> screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for<br>
